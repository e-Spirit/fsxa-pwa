= Hidden sections visibility configuration

. <<Introduction>>
. <<Usage>>

== Introduction

It is possible to toggle the visibility of section elements.

== Usage

You can add the `FSXA_DISPLAY_HIDDEN_SECTIONS` environment variable to your application.
If the variable is set to `true`, all sections will be shown. This is the default setting.
If you set it to `false`, hidden sections will not be displayed.

The application determines whether a section is hidden based on its `displayed` attribute.
Only if the attribute is present and explicitly set to `false` will a section be interpreted as hidden.

> **NOTE**: The conecpt of hidden sections does not exist in the release state. 
To avoid irritation, we recommend not setting `FSXA_DISPLAY_HIDDEN_SECTIONS` at all for applications that use the release state.
