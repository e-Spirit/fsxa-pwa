. <<Introduction>>
. <<Usage>>

== Introduction

The FSXADisplayHiddenSectionElement toggles visibility of Section Elements. You can show or hide the section elements
using an environment variable.

== Usage

You can add the `FSXA_DISPLAY_HIDDEN_SECTIONS` env variable to your application.
If the variable is set to `true`, all sections will be shown. This is the default setting.
If you set it to `false`, hidden sections will not be displayed.

The application determines whether a section is hidden based on its `displayed` attribute.
Only if the attribute is present and explicitly set to `false` will a section be interpreted as hidden.
