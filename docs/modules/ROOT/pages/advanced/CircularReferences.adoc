= Circular References
In FirstSpirit you can create circular references in your project.
An example for circular references could be two datasets that contain a reference to each other.  
While the FSXA stack can handle circular references, it is the responsibility of the component developer to ensure that the components handle this correctly.

NOTE: The vuejs/devtools[https://github.com/vuejs/devtools] are currently *unable* to handle circular references!
