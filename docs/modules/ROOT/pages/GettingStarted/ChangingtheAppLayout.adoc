= Changing the App Layout

In the app layout you can specify a frame for all pages.
For example, if all pages include navigation, it can be specified there.

Thereby the FSXABaseAppLayout is extended to adjust attributes like the `appState` and `appError`. More information can be found link:../components/FSXABaseAppLayout{outfilesuffix}[here].

In the JSX/TSX context `{this.$slots.default}` defines where the contents of the container will be displayed.

Example:

[source,javascript]
----
render(){
  return (
    <div>
        <Navigation />
        {this.$slots.default}
    </div>)
}
----

In the SFC context this is achieved with `<slot></slot>`.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<template>
  <div>
    <Navigation />
    <slot></slot>
  </div>
</template>
----

Furthermore, here you have all the possibilities that have already been described in the chapters link:MyFirstTemplate{outfilesuffix}[My First Template] and link:CustomCSS{outfilesuffix}[Custom CSS].
