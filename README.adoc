= FSXA-PWA

The FSXA-PWA is an example project and can be used as basis for developing your own PWA
in the context of the FirstSpirit Experience Accelerator.

== About the FSXA

The FirstSpirit Experience Accelerator (FSXA) is the hybrid solution of a digital
experience platform, combining a headless approach with enterprise capabilities.
The FSXA stack consists of five repositories:

* https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-pwa[FSXA-PWA]
* https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-ui[FSXA-UI / Component Library]
* https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-nuxt-module[FSXA-Nuxt-Module]
* https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-pattern-library[FSXA-Pattern-Library]
* https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-api[FSXA-API]

While the FSXA-API is a maintained product with a life cycle, the FSXA-PWA, FSXA-UI, FSXA-Nuxt-Module and FSXA-Pattern-Library are merely best practices examples how a project could be set up and integrate the FSXA-API.
The latter repositories can be forked to speed up the startup time of a frontend project or to understand how common use cases can be solved in headless projects.
The code itself can therefore also be used as documentation of best practices.
